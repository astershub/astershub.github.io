    <h1>Aster Pontillas</h1>
    <p>
      A writer most comfortable with creative non-fiction and poetry, Aster Pontillas (he/him) frequently explores with identity in relation to culture and queerness, and many of his works are inspired by his own experiences growing up as a first-generation migrant and a transgender Asian man. But, he is also an avid gamer and has a deep appreciation for visual art, so lately he's been interested in digital writing and intertwining visual art with literature in the form of ekphrases.
