      A writer most comfortable with creative non-fiction and poetry, Aster Pontillas (he/him) frequently explores with identity in relation to culture and queerness, and many of his works are inspired by his own experiences growing up as a first-generation migrant and a transgender Asian man. But, he is also an avid gamer and has a deep appreciation for visual art, so lately he's been interested in digital writing and intertwining visual art with literature in the form of ekphrases.

    <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
    <p>
      Exploring the human experience is what I always strive for in my pieces. I want to touch on human emotions like grief and relationships like family, and expand on them in a vivid and artistic way so that my readers can relate to them and reflect. I always aim for my works to have high relatability and touching stories, even with how abstract they are. I tend to make use of imagery and experimentation, particularly with digital media, in order to tell these stories.
More specifically, I like drawing from personal experiences so I can have an even deeper connection with my work. I like taking unique experiences I have had and exploring them in depth with my writing. This is not only a way for me to come to terms with what I have confronted in my life. It is also a way for me to express to my readers what it means to be who I am, as well as inspire or comfort anyone who may be the same and let them know that they are not alone.
That, in essence, is what my main purpose for writing is: to explore the human condition, and to comfort people through the arduous function of being human. Iâ€™m often inspired by works that aim to bring a similar message. Video games and visual novels often leave a lasting impact on me, as well as other forms of digital writing. Seeing how other people use the digital format to write stories in creative ways inspires me to be more creative with my writing, so I experiment with platforms such as Twine and Bitsy to tell stories in more ways than just words on a page.
